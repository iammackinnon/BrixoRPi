# BrixoRPi
Connect to Brixo using a computer
This is based on the standard free Brixo API formerly available at http://brixotoys.com/pythonapi/ 

It was designed to connect to Brixo via a Windows PC and it is copied here for reference

The modification needed to run the same code in lux and RPi are trivial, simply change the use of COM4 by the appropiate /dev/
Here we implement the modification, tested in a RPi3 with Raspbian Stretch using Python 2.7
